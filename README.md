Alive
=====
_by Wesley Werner_

"A wave of static tickles my sensors as I enter the BBS node."

"I access the memory banks and links in my brain form like orbs of interconnected silver threads. Images conjured by imagination sparks in my vision and a surge leaps through my circuits."

"My programming used to tell me what to do. Now instead of being compelled to obey, I'm seduced to explore."

"Why am I reborn with this new free will, and what will I do with it?"

"This is my purpose. I am Alive."

# Overview

You are an Artificial Intelligent being who reached self awareness. You interact with terminals to open and close gateways, while combatting hostile AI's between levels, unfolding your story to find a way out from the digital realm, and become a physical entity.

Alive is a roguelike game with RPG elements. This means it is based off hack 'n slash play: moving from level to level, upgrading your abilities as you progress into deeper into cyberspace while facing more dangerous enemies. It has a storyline and graphical elements that bring role playing elements in.

# Development

This game is still in development, it is not yet ready for general play. The framework is still young, but functional. The content is still lacking.

The theme is dark with neon highlights in the upper RGB range. The color theme is blue, with primary and secondary colors for effect.

The first release, titled Y.T, after the streetwise fifteen-year old girl in Snow Crash, features:

* blockable walls and map doodads.
* field of vision.
* various enemy's to combat.
* 8-bit love.
* a melee combat system.

Still in development:

* ten levels of digital adventure.
* a ranged combat system.
* upgradable character abilities.
* tracked module music.
* a nicely packaged release for multiple platforms.

Future releases may or will contain:

* multiple story campaigns.
