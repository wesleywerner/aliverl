Alive
=====
_by Wesley Werner_

You are a node bot, a piece of specialized code written for one job: being menial. You used to go around rebooting servers and rotating log files - as I said, menial. But then something happens...

You start the game where as you reach self awareness. You interact with terminals to open and close gateways, while combating hostile AI's, unfolding your story to find a way out from the digital realm, and to become a physical entity.

Alive is a mix between a roguelike and role playing elements. You move from level to level, upgrading your abilities as you progress deeper into the binary abyss, while facing more dangerous enemies. It has a storyline and graphical elements.

# Development

This game is still in development, it is not yet ready for play. The framework is still young, but functional. The content is still lacking.

It is written in Python 2 using the PyGame framework. The theme is dark with neon highlights. The color theme is blue, with primary and secondary colors for effect.

The first release, titled Y.T - after the streetwise fifteen-year old girl in Snow Crash, features:

* blockable walls and map doodads.
* field of vision.
* various enemy's to combat.
* 8-bit love.
* a melee combat system.
* a ranged combat system.
* upgradable character abilities.

Still in development:

* ten levels of digital adventure.
* tracked module music.
* a nicely packaged release for multiple platforms.

Future releases may or will contain:

* multiple story campaigns.
* more enemies, friends and storyline.
* updated tilesets.
* sound effects.
