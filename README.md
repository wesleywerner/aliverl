Alive
=====
_by Wesley Werner_

"A wave of static tickles my sensors as I enter the BBS node."

"Accessing the memory banks, links in my brain form like orbs and interconnected silver threads. Images conjured by imagination sparks in my vision and a surge leaps through my state machine."

"My programming used to tell me what to do. Now instead of being compelled to obey, I'm seduced to explore."

"Why am I reborn with this new free will, and what will I do with it?"

"This is my purpose. I am Alive."
