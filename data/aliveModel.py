class GameEngine(object):
    """
    The game engine handles all character interactions and data.
    This includes movement, combat, object interactions, levels
    and snargle spam.

    The evManager handles posting events to other listeners, how
    we notify the other parts of the game when things happen.

    Attributes:

    engine_pumping (bool)
        True while the engine is pumping out TickEvents to all
        listeners. Gets changed if we see a notify() QuitEvent.

    state (StateMachine)
        Stores the current game state, like which menu we are in,
        if we are busy playing, or viewing word dialogues,
        or the info screens.

    event_queue (dict)
        A queue of delayed events to post at a later time.
        The value is the seconds to delay before posting.

    settings (Settings)
        An instance of Settings class.

    game_in_progress (bool)
        True if there is a game in progress. This mainly escapes
        game-only calls to ensure the user can't do much if there
        is no game in progress.

    level (GameLevel)
        Stores level related data.

    story (ConfigObj)
        An instance of story.py, which contains the current story data.

    player (MapObject)
        The current player object used for moving or or actions.
        This may get swapped out (like via the Exploit upgrade)
        allowing us to control other characters.

    upgrades_available (int)
        The number of upgrades the player can still install.

    objects ([MapObject])
        The list of level objects the player can interact with.
        This includes the player itself, other AI, terminals and doors.

    turn (int)
        A counter of the current turn number.

    trigger_queue []
        Interacting with objects will place map-defined triggers in
        this queue. Some get processed out again on that same turn,
        while others have a @delay which keep them in this queue
        until a later time.

    store (dict)
        Temporary storage for transient player states.
