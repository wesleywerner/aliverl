# level one

* a small orientation level that has a coule of terminals and a door.
* using a terminal in the last room, you get a message that you are summoned to file node delta.
* you are yanked to the next node.

# level two

"The big reboot"

* we are not in hostile mode yet, the story will unfold soon to bring the action.
* you step forward and a terminal reveals a mail from the system: the file node core has crashed, your job is to reboot it. the tail of the log ends the mail.
* heading north you find a closed door, the terminal next to it prints out a very busy process list, and a halted message. you tell yourself to find the override switches on the level to reset the terminal.
* you head east and need to toggle 3 switches in succession to complete the reset override.
* the first room is packed with ICE running back and forth, they must be working frantically to handle the node downtime.
* you proceed the toggle the other two switches further on without much incident.
* the core door now opens via the switch next to it, you enter.
* you note how the core room looks ill, the cpu is discolored and the walls are red.
* you login to the only large terminal in the room, it spews forth errors and you lament "What the heck is going on with this server?".
* the login proceeds and it asks the core to restart nicely. it also says you have mail but a file open error prevents from showing it.
* you mention that your work here is done, and to find a working terminal in another node to read that mail. you also think "what *is* going on today?".
* a few short turns later the *core reboots* and the cpu changes color.
* a few turns thereafter each capacitor pops in turn. oops.
* you derez out of there.

# level three

"anomalies may occur"

* This is a small interlude level.
* You find a terminal and login to see your email. The daily fortune reads "You will outgrow your usefulness."
* A message from security says an anomaly was detected. Expect node malfunctions and bizarre behaviour. It says you must report to the diagnostics node for a code scan.
* you comment you'd rather catch up on some forum posts.
* actioning the terminal again, you read a reply post about implementing a snargle-function in a foo module. "ha, of course!" you think.
* actioning some of the servers show logs and process stats.
* You set off to the next node: diagnostics.
* a smaller terminal will issue you an upgrade.

# level four

"the doctor will see you now"

* Enter a room called Transport Hub. It is busy with AI working at terminals.
* Moving through to each of the passages tips you as the room you are entering:
* The Conduit:
    * A bunch of capacitors.
* Storage:
    * A bunch of blinken servers.
    * Acting on some of the terminals gives you upgrades:
        --upgrade server--
        Status: online
        $: sudo apt-get upgrade
        password for #00022: *******
        issuing new upgrades.... Success.
* Build lab:
    * A bunch of servers processing stuff.
* Diagnostics:
    * The door closes behind you as you enter.
    * There are AI working around other broken AI - they do not animate too well.
    * One of the working AI approaches you and a dialogue begins.
    * "I am here for a scan. What is this about?" you ask.
    * "Object #00022 - disable any upgrades you have installed and enter the scan-box over there." the doctor says.
    * "I don't have any upgrades. What are you looking for by the way...?" you ask.
    * "Unknown command 'what'." it says.
    * "Err, um... :$ diagnostic --query --verbose" you reply.
    *   -- security report --
        Status: Intrusion Counter-measure Electronics detected an anomaly.
        Severity: Purple Alert.
        Action: Perform system wide scans on all AI and code bot monkeys.
        Detection: No signature identified. Use Bayesian filters.
        Resolve: Deconstruct and disassemble any suspect AI.
        Disclosure: Internal and need to know only.
    * "Deconstruct? Disassemble? Purple? Hang on, those do not sound like fun!"
    * it replies:
        > --start bot code license agreement--
        > we own you.
        > --end of agreement--
    * "Fine. Let's get this over with. I have work to do and those logs are not going to rotate themselves..."
    * As you move into the scan area the scan starts:
        load scan module...OK
        load snafu module...OK
        load feeper unit test...OK
        starting scan on code #00022...
    * you think, "This is pointless, I feel fine..."
    *   analyzing bot code...
        warning: variable is not set.
        warning: test failure.
        error: anomaly detected!
        error: an error ocurred!
        another error: and error about an error was raised!
        seriously critical error: wtf?!
        initializing devastating deconstruction...
    * "Hey wait a minute! Don't deconstruct me! I like how I am!" you shout.
    *   sending alert to security - failed to contain anomaly - DoorsOS will now dump.
        *DUMPS*
    * A door opens, a hostile AI comes at you!
    * The entrance door opens after your scan. "I better get out of here!" shows as you leave the room.


# level five

"a bot with a plan"

* You find info on a term about a backup node that hosts copies of AI's. You figure you can use it to clone yourself and increase your chance of survival.
* It also shows a warning: AI #1223 classified as a foreign process. Find and destroy. Eeep!
* You encounter an AI who you ask for access to the backup node. It requests you to verify with an electronic signature. You agree to send it soon.
* You find a series of terminals, through them you unlock a signature. You look for a secure comms node from where to send your new signature to get backup access.
* You find the comms node and send the signature. You now have backup access.
* After passing a series of locked doors, you find the master backup terminal. You access it and the backup starts.
* You see a copy of yourself appear. Interacting with it reveals nothing but a dumb AI. A blinking master backup terminal shows a backup failed, anomaly detected.
