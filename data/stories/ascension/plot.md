# level one

* You are a bot code working in a node. Wandering in your small space, you see a terminal blink to life with a waiting message.
* The message reads: the server crashed, you are tasked to find the node control and reboot the server. A door opens and you venture out.
* You pass some vacuum tubes and an AI too busy with it's work to notice you.
* Entering the central node room, you unlock the console and login, and issue the server reboot command.
* The terminal says you have mail as it shuts down, but can't read it in the node that is now rebooting.
* You tell yourself to go to the next node to be able to read your mail. Off you go.

# level two

* You find a terminal and login to see your email. The daily fortune reads ironically.
* A message from security to all AI's mentions an anomaly that was detected. Expect node malfunctions and bizarre behaviour. It says you are one of many AI whose process has been altered by the anomaly, and you must report to the diagnostics node for a code scan.
* You set off to the next node: diagnostics.
* <filler>

# level three

* <filler>
* You login at the diagnostics terminal. It runs a scan on you, and detects something! It says you need to be rebuilt, and starts a deconstruction routine. The process halts with many furious errors, and the terminal session closes. You shout, "don't deconstruct me!"
* The exit door must be unlocked, and as you do so it shows a warning: AI #1223 classified as a foreign process. Find and destroy. Eeep!

# level four

* You find info on a term about a backup node that hosts copies of AI's. You figure you can use it to clone yourself and increase your chance of survival.
* You encounter an AI who you ask for access to the backup node. It requests you to verify with an electronic signature. You agree to send it soon.
* You find a series of terminals, through them you unlock a signature. You look for a secure comms node from where to send your new signature to get backup access.
* You find the comms node and send the signature. You now have backup access.
* After passing a series of locked doors, you find the master backup terminal. You access it and the backup starts.
* You see a copy of yourself appear. Interacting with it reveals nothing but a dumb AI. A blinking master backup terminal shows a backup failed, anomaly detected.
