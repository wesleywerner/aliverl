# RELEASE Y.T.

## implement ability actions

* better drawing of the upgrade info screen - show selected ugprade details.

* add a 'ondeath' object action that triggers during combat - what was this for again?

* create the menu with story selection

* save game state
    This should be backwards compatible from older versions.
    The configObj might be useful for this.

* find music to play randomly from a playlist. remove from playlist once played.

* interactingwith AI removes their map-level attribute overrides:
    * kill interaction "modes" on "keke"
    * kill interaction "speed" on "keke"
  This does not affect gameplay as these values were already consumed at level load. Just saying.

* smooth sprite and viewport movement

* site upload issue: find scp does not do directory structure :(

# Changes

* build a character screen to show with sections:
    * player, game and level info, recent messages
    * current and available upgrades
    * achievements

* the player can choose a tile to target.

* action upgrades that require a target, and those that have a timed effect.
