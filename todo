# RELEASE Y.T.

* bug: map level overrides of object modes should ignore superfluous spaces after commas

* bug: los test shows bottom-right sides obscured (correct), while top-left sides can see through corners.

* create the menu with story selection, or resume a previously saved game.

* auto save the current game.

* configure list of songs to loop during play. see if we can pause when switching to the main menu while a game is in progress.
