# RELEASE Y.T.

* ui rework
    - need to separate widget drawing from context. some widgets have move-to destinations and still need drawing even outside of context.
    - use a visible attribute to decide if a widget should draw.
    - context swithcing sets widgets invisible who are outside of context, unless they are busy moving.
    - widgets set themselves invisible when finished moving and are outside of context.
    - clicking only triggers widgets in context.

* create @ontrigger @set or @counters that increment. during the trigger then test for @oncounter and if the value equals.

* need a @command to change an object property values, like "type" and "modes".

* create the menu with story selection, or resume a previously saved game.

* configure list of songs to loop during play. see if we can pause when switching to the main menu while a game is in progress.

* site upload issue: find scp does not do directory structure :(

* bug: los test shows bottom-right sides obscured, while top-left sides can see through corners. A result of the get_line_segements returning non asymmetrical angles
