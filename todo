# RELEASE Y.T.

* site upload issue: find scp does not do directory structure :(

* build a character screen to show with sections:
    * player, game and level info, recent messages
    * current and available upgrades
    * achievements

* add a 'ondeath' object action that triggers during combat - what was this for again?

* create the menu with story selection

* save game state
    This should be backwards compatible from older versions.
    The configObj might be useful for this.

* find music to play randomly from a playlist. remove from playlist once played.
