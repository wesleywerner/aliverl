* tech out reading json strings as python dictionaries.

* draw the map tiles. I like 32x32 blocks.

* flesh out ten levels with tile and objects.

* drink coffee.

* create a list of map tiles that are interactive. 
  these should enhance level gameplay via solving puzzles.



[wishlist]

* tracked module music. I have some I wrote, but ideally for this task
    to work I need to 1) contact modders who would like to offer their
    work, 2) tech out a module player library. libmikmod is first choice.
