* add an abilities screen that shows available upgrades

* add the UI button class

* add a 'ondeath' object action that triggers during combat

* implement abilities

* create the menu with story selection

* save game state

* find music to play randomly from a playlist. remove from playlist once played.

* if a 'ai' object type is not defined in story.py then it fails:

    line 214, in movecharacter self.healcharacters()
    File "aliveModel.py", line 279, in healcharacters
        if npc.health < npc.maxhealth:
    AttributeError: 'Mapobject' object has no attribute 'health'

# done

* implement a player walked path for 'follower' ai modes to pick up on if they cross it. (a future ability will reduce your path history)
