# RELEASE Y.T.

* auto save the current game.

* create the menu with story selection, or resume a previously saved game.

* smooth sprite and viewport movement

* configure list of songs to loop during play. see if we can pause when switching to the main menu while a game is in progress.

* site upload issue: find scp does not do directory structure :(

* bug: los test shows bottom-right sides obscured, while top-left sides can see through corners. A result of the get_line_segements returning non asymmetrical angles

## achievements
