# RELEASE Y.T.

* trigger events after x turns:
  * process triggers from a list

* add an abilities screen that shows available upgrades

* add the UI button class

* add a 'ondeath' object action that triggers during combat

* implement abilities

* create the menu with story selection

* save game state
    This should be backwards compatible from older versions.
    The configObj might be useful for this.

* find music to play randomly from a playlist. remove from playlist once played.
